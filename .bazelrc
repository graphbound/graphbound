# Specifies desired output mode for running tests.
# Valid values are
#   'summary' to output only test status summary
#   'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests
#   'all' to print logs for all tests
#   'streamed' to output logs for all tests in real time
#     (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless of --test_strategy value).

# When running `bazel coverage` --instrument_test_targets needs to be set in
# order to collect coverage information from test targets

# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# user.bazelrc should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with
# team members
# This needs to be last statement in this config, as the user configuration
# should be able to overwrite flags from this file.
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc
# (Note that we use .bazelrc.user so the file appears next to .bazelrc in
# directory listing, rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)
